Please answer the following questions honestly, and I will do my utmost to interpret your responses:

Nature of Reality

Do you believe that objects continue to exist even when they’re not being observed, or do you feel they exist primarily in your perception?
Yes, objects continue to exist even when they’re not being observed.

Do you believe that knowledge comes only from your senses, or do you think there might be inborn ideas or reasoning that doesn’t rely entirely on experience?
Mind and Matter
probably

Do you think the mind is separate from the body (a dualist perspective), or do you lean toward the view that everything is ultimately physical, including thoughts?
Truth and Observation
Lean towards everything being physical, but can't explain what the fuck consiousness is so i dunno

When you consider an event, do you prefer to see it as having a reality independent of any observer, or do you believe the observer plays a defining role in shaping what “really” happens?
Certainty
Is this a free will question?  Once again, I don't know.

Do you think we can ever know anything with absolute certainty, or is all knowledge somewhat uncertain or probable?
 I think therefore I am,  The rest is up for debate.
